# Mastering Bitcoin

This repository contains the complete audio book for the [first edition, second print](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/releases/tag/Edition1Print2) of Mastering Bitcoin. The first release was created by converting the asciidoc files into HTML and TXT files then using the TXT files to recording speech to text in the m4a format. In the future, other audio formats (mp3, ogg, acc etc) and translations will be added.

# Reading this book (Where is the PDF, TXT, & Audio Edition of the Second Edition?)

To read this book, see [book.asciidoc](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/book.asciidoc). Click on each of the chapters to read in your browser. This is not as convenient as reading a PDF or an ebook on your e-reader, for which there is a cost (see below).

The 2nd edition of "Mastering Bitcoin" is available under a CC-BY-NC-ND license, not a CC-BY-SA license.

Therefore an audio book is a "derivative" product, which is what the ND prohibits. 

According to [original repo](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/) the book will eventually (within a year of publication) be released under a CC-BY-SA license, at which point the audio book format and translations will be allowed. Until then, making audio copies violates the license and interferes with the publisher's (and the author's) ability to make a living. Furthermore, if you make it so the publisher can't recoup their investment, they will delay the release into CC-BY-SA.

The book's source code, found in this repository, is kept synchronized with the print and ebook editions.
